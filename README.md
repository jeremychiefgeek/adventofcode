# Advent of Code

Welcome! 👋 This is my personal repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), the annual programming challenge that runs every December.

## 🎄 Current Focus: 2024 (Yes, a Little Late)

I'm currently working through the **2024** edition — a bit behind schedule, but still enjoying the puzzles and learning along the way. Progress over perfection!

Each day's challenge is solved in its own file/folder. I’m aiming to write clean, readable solutions, and occasionally trying out new tools or languages along the way.

## 🗃️ Repo Structure

For now, everything is in one repo, but eventually I plan to split the code **by year**, so each edition of Advent of Code will have its own directory (or even its own repo if it makes sense). That way it stays clean and easier to navigate over time.

Example future structure:

```
├── 2024
    ├── dayone
    ├── daytwo
  │ └── ...
  ├── 2025
  │ └── ...
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- Keep my problem-solving skills sharp
- Play around with new languages or tools
- Just for fun — because puzzles are fun 🙂

Feel free to browse, borrow ideas, or follow along!
